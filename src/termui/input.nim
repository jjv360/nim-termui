## Represents a key event, kinda following the JavaScript standard defined at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent
class KeyboardEvent:

    ## Returns a Boolean that is true if the Alt (Option or ⌥ on OS X) key was active when the key event was generated.
    var altKey = false

    ## Returns a string with the code value of the physical key represented by the event.
    # var code = ""

    ## Returns a Boolean that is true if the Ctrl key was active when the key event was generated.
    var ctrlKey = false

    ## Returns a string representing the key value of the key represented by the event. This can be used for saving the typed character to a text field, etc.
    ## If the length of this string is 1, it is most likely an input character and not a control key.
    var key = ""

    ## Returns a Boolean that is true if the Meta key (on Mac keyboards, the ⌘ Command key; on Windows keyboards, the Windows key (⊞)) was active when the key event was generated.
    var metaKey = false

    ## Returns a Boolean that is true if the Shift key was active when the key event was generated.
